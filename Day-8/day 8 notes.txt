can't use bool and none 

Every thing should be in one object everything is consider as class

Named tuple:

namedtuple(typename,fieldname)



from collections import namedtuple
student=namedtuple('student',['name,'age','grade','score'])
student=student(


Dictionaries:

unordered,mutuable

key:value pair
key unqiue
student={"name":"sandhiya","age":16}
cannot have two items in values

creating dictionary:
dictionary_name={}
dictionary_name=dict()->dict method

example:
players={1:"dhoni",2:"kholi"}
print(players[2])----->key values printing o/p:Kholi

If the value is not found:

print(my_dict.get("email"))---->o/p:none
print(my_dict.get("email","not found"))------>o/p:not found
