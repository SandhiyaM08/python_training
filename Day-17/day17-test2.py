'''Write a  program that:
Takes a string input from the user.
Prints the word 'hello' as many times as the number of characters in the input string.
You may only use one variable to achieve this.
Do not use any alphanumeric variable names (i.e., variable name cannot contain letters or numbers).
Must use a for loop to print 'hello' repeatedly.


_=input()
for _ in range(len(_)):
	print("hello")'''

for _ in(input("Enter string:")):
	print("hello")
