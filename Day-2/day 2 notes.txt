Day 2

complier and interpreter

Data types
Numeric
	int
	float
	complex

Sequence:
	string
	    string can't convert to int and float

	set 
	tuple
dict

other type
	frozenset-[()] combination of list and tuple
	Nonetype-Keyword None[returns the empty value]
	Boolean - Keyword 'bool' (true or false)

Built-in Functions:
	type() - finding the type 
	find() - finding the string
	print()
 	len()-total length of string (in) keyword
		:
    		text ="sandhiya Muthumani"
    		print("sandhiya" in text)

Slicing:

text="python"
print(text[::-1])

starts from 0 
postive[0:3],[2::5]-index 2 and takes every 5th character
eg:
t="python program"
print(t[2::5])
tpa

negative[::-1] from last (from back index starts from -1)
reverse[start pos, end pos, occurence]

Concatenation:
joining 2 strings

Formatting:

name = "Muthu"
age = 25

print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))


print("My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.".format(name="Muthu", age=25))


Standalone functions:

upper()-print(text.upper())
lower()
capitalize()
title()-first letter capital

New line commands:
\n - newline
\t - tab
\\ - to add string \ include
\" 
	text = "He said, \"Hello there!\""
	print(text)
	o\p:He said, "Hello there!"


Homework: 

qn. v1=2,v2=3 => which is bigger
#declaring values
v1=2
v2=3
#creating tuple
val=(v1,v2)
#true[1],false[0]
ind=(v1<v2)
print(val[ind])


1)dictionary is ordered or unordered.

Before 3.7 it is unordered like keys and values ,the dictionary can print the different keys .
After 3.7 it become the ordered ,that is in which we insert the values while looping the same order is inserted.
 
2)range support decimal or not.

Range() built-in function does not support decimal value .
If we want to the decimal values in form of range we can use numpy library func 
We have to import numpy and we can use arange[numpy.arange] 

 
3)how can use none - its keywords or datatypes.
 It's both keyword and datatypes
 But we can't use it as a variable name
 
4)double,long comes under what.
long is interger datatype, python 2 we separate long and int now in python 3 only int
double is float datatype
 
5)1e6 - float or int
1e6=1*10^6=10,00,000.0
2e8=2*10^8
It's float
 
6)why aren't all decimal calculation exact in python?
Computers store numbers in binary (base-2), not decimal (base-10).
computer store floats using global system =>IEEE 754
 



 HP launches AI-powered OmniBook 5 and 3 laptops in India, starting at ₹69,999
The laptops are available now in India in a single “Glacier Silver” colour. Pricing starts at ₹75,999 for the OmniBook 5 and ₹69,999 for both OmniBook 3 variants.	

Beyond Grok, update 2025.26 also introduces Light Sync for the new Model 3 and Model Y, 2026 Model S/X, and Cybertruck, allowing accent lights to pulse with your music 

Qus greater number:

opt1:
#declaring values
v1=2
v2=3
#creating tuple
val=(v1,v2)
#true[1],false[0]
ind=(v1<v2)
print(val[ind])


opt2:
a, b = 4, 5
bigger = a * bool(a > b) + b * bool(b > a)
print("The bigger number is:", bigger)

opt3:
a, b = 2,3
bigger = sorted([a, b])[-1]
print("The bigger number is:", bigger)

solution:
a=2
b=3
print("v1 is bigger than v2-the statement is",{v1>v2})
