UNIX:

1960,os

types:
sun solaris
gnu/Linux
macos x

unix based system

components:

kernel
shell
program

unix kernel:
kernel is core of unix

unix everything is file or process
core design principle of unix

processs:
running/executing program
excute :
python myscript.py

file:
text file(code)
binary file(executable)
directories(folders that store other files)

directory:(file)
/home/user

a directory file contain:
names and metadata of files

ls/ld=read

unix commands:

ls-list contents of directory(%ls)

ls-a-->see hidden files

mkdir filename-->

pwd-->absolute path

cat filename-->not ideal for long files
less filename-->display file contents(entire text file)
more filename
grep -c word filename-->count
grep -v 
grep -ivc word filename-->that don't match word
word count wc -w filename

unix commands:
 
ls => list content of a dictionary
 
ls -a => see hidden files
 
ls -l
 
create a directory :
 
mkdir unixstuff
 
change directory :
 
cd unixstuff
 
current directory : cd .
parent directory : cd ..
 
to come out all folders => cd
 
pwd => print current absolute path.
 
ps =>
 
create a file :
touch <file_name_1><file_name_2>...<file_name_n>
 
display line of text:
 
echo[options][string]
 
using ~ for home directory:
ls ~
ls ~/parentfolder
ls ~/..
 
absolute path =>start with root
relative path =>
 
copying files
 
to change within folder:
cp source_file target_file
 
move or rename:
mv source destination 
to move with folder:
 
delete a file :
rm filename
 
delete a folder (must be empty)
rmdir dirname
 
clear
 
display file contents:
cat <file_name> =>not ideal for long files =>it scroll past quickly
 
less <file_name> =>view file one page at a time
 
q => to end
 
more <file_name> => views
 
 
view beginning of file:
 
head file_name =>first 10 lines
 
head -5 file_name =>first 5 lines
 
view end of file:
 
tail file_name =>last 10 lines
 
tail -15 file_name =>last 15 lines
 
set difference:
set1={1,2,3}
set2={1,2}
print(set1-set2)

or set1.difference(set2)

sysmetric difference(removes the commom element)

subset checking:(<=)
print(A.issubset(B))
print(c<=A)--->check it is a subset not condition

proper subset:(all elements should present )(<)

superset checking:(>=)

disjoint set:(no common values)(ans Boolean)(isdisjoint)

frozen set:(immutable)(changeable)

regular set:(mutable)
